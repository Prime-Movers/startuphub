# startuphub
Startup Hub is the most innovative place for every individual who is interested in starting up their business ideas into a real business, irrespective of the money required for the start-up process. 
Getting a government-authorized patent is quite difficult as compared to private patents since it has more value.
Promoting a startup hub among the biggest companies is quite difficult. Analyzing recent patents available in government databases to check whether the product implemented does not belong to some other companies. 
Authenticating the companies and users before they are allowed to have their place in the hub.
